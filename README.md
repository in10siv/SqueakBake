# SqueakBake

This is an addon for blender that helps you to automate the squeaks and screeches of rotating objects to get 3d soundFx.

  Instead of adding the tracks manually and trying to match the movement to the sound use this addon. It duplicates the NLA soundtrack for every change in rotation direction or after a brake in the euler rotation for the specified axis.


The interface is simple
          


You can find the tool in the Speaker Properties
1 - just chose the name of the NLA tracks (it will replace all the tracks with that name, just don't name it "SoundTrack")

2 - chose the object that you are referencing, from the list or with the picker

3 - chose the axis

and Bake



I hope you enjoy it. :)

The addon will soon have more options to add sound while in action or on changes of action, to ad tracks for movement (best for sliders, actuators, hydraulics).

Upcoming Updates:
monitor movement or scale
ability to customize when to add tracks (in action, or changes of action)
speed improvements on heavy scenes 
options to link the speaker object to the target and move it in position
support for different rotation type like Quaternion(WXYZ)
ability to get the deformation from bones and fcurve animations


With your support i will be able to ad all this to the addon.



Enjoy
